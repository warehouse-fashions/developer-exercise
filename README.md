# Warehouse Web Developer Exercise

In this excercise we would like you to build a web component similar to this [screenshot](recommendation_screenshot.png) using the [JSON](data/recommendations.json) provided. Creativity is accepted but do not alter the JSON. The component you build should display images, prices and link to the product taking into consideration how it would work with i18n.

### Requirements
* Responsive
* Reusable code

Please fork this repository and commit your changes for review.

Amend this Readme in your forked repo and use your commits to outline the component you have created and the decisions that you have made.
